This is a simple, dummy, individual based movement model. It has no biology, and no data. Each individual follows a correlated random walk, where step length is a function of ageMap, i.e., a map of forest age.

## Plotting

The module plots 1 plot: a cumulative occurrence map, i.e., counts of the number of times that a caribou landed on a pixel.

## Saving

There is no default saving. The saving follows the .saveInterval and .save
